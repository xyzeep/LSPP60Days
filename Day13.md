# Day 13 â€” 60 Days of Learning  
**Date:** 2025/06/13  

## Today I  
- tried to implement BFS to solve a maze  
- added queue logic and cell tracking with SDL3  
- rendered the maze grid and current player location  

## I Learned  
- how to manage a queue manually using arrays  
- that tracking visited nodes and parent links is important  
- that even small typos can break your code completely

# Day 10 â€” 60 Days of Learning

**Date:** 2025/06/10  

## Today I

- focused on understanding search algorithms  
- reviewed BFS and DFS in detail  

## I Learned

- how BFS explores level by level and uses a queue
- how DFS goes deep first using a stack or recursion  
- when to use BFS over DFS or vice versa

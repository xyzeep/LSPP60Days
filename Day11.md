# Day 11 â€” 60 Days of Learning
**Date:** 2025/06/11 

## Today I

- learned how the A* algorithm works
- learned the importance of heuristic functions in informed search
- learned how to calculate g(n), h(n), and f(n)

## I Learned

- that A* uses both actual cost and estimated cost (g + h)
- that A* always expands the most optimized path based on lowest f(n)
- why choosing a good heuristic makes searching faster and more memory-efficient
- that A* can be used for puzzles, mazes, and even string transformations

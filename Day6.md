# Day 6 â€” 60 Days of Learning
**Date:** 2025/06/06  


## Today I

- used SDL renderer instead of a window surface to draw graphics
- introduced and fixed errors related to game states
- refined code for better redability
- learned about textures and the differences between surface and renderer
- 


## I Learned

- that using a renderer gives more control for rendering compared to drawing on the window surface
- why reading documentation is important
- that staring blankly at the code for 43 minutes counts as productive
